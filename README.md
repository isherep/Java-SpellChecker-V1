AUTHORS: Iryna Sherepot


### USER INSTRUCTIONS: To use a spellCheck function, please create a new object SpellChecker passing the dictionary file you would like to check words against.
### After dictionary was created, you can spell check word by calling the SpellChecker instance method checkWord(String wordToCheck)

The checkWord() function will  perform two types of corrections on the incoming word and then return the corrected word:
It fixes bad casing:
“england” → “England”

It removes invalid repeating characters:
“tabble” → “table”

* If the incoming word is already correct, the function returns the original word. * 
* If no correction can be found, the function returns the string “No Correction Found”. *

Tests are provided is the  SpellTest.java. 

The project assumes the following:
- any number of character duplication can be made
- duplication can occur more than once, 
- bad casing can occur more than one time in the word at any letter, 
- word can have both casing and duplication errors at the same time
- If the two possible correct spellings of the word is possible, the function picks first one.
